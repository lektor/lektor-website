I am using lektor for my personal blog, project showcase and professional website.

It showcases a simple mobile first responsive design, how to use multiple languages, tags and a blog with atom feeds. It also shows how to deploy to a github static page with a custom domain.

The source is [on BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/dwt/homepage/) and you can [view the page here](https://häcker.net).
