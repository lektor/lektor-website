This is my personal website. It includes a simple about page, a [blog](https://www.ft.io/blog/), and a curated list of [interesting links](https://www.ft.io/links/). I write about product management, go-to-market, strategy, and design. 

I've written two custom plugins for my Lektor site:

- One fetches links for my linkblog from [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:ft). Since Pinboard doesn't supply webhooks, I've written a custom Netlify function that checks for new bookmarks on Pinboard and triggers a rebuild/deployment when necessary.
- The other generates dynamic [link preview images](https://www.ft.io/blog/link-preview-images/) used by Twitter and the like to make sharing content from my site more engaging and visual.

The site is hosted on Netlify, which I cannot recommend highly enough.
