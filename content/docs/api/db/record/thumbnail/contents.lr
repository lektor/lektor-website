body:

This method is available on attachments that are images and can be used to
automatically generate a thumbnail.  The return value is a thumbnail proxy
that can be either use directly or with the `|url` filter.

If cropping is not enabled the thumbnail is scaled down to fit into the
given reactangle of width and height.  If height is not specified it will
match the width and the height is set accordingly.  If cropping is enabled
it's cropped around the edges to fit into the center.

It provides the following attributes:

* `width`: the thumbnail width in pixels.
* `height`: the thumbnail height in pixels.
* `url_path` the URL path of the thumbnail.  This is absolute and needs to
  be made relative with the `|url` filter.

Note that for images that are rotated according to the "Orientation" EXIF
header, the created thumbnail will be rotated back to the correct orientation.

!!! Starting with Lektor 2.0 you can also pass `crop=True` to crop the image
to the exact dimensions provided instead of scaling it uncropped.

## Example

```html+jinja
{% for image in this.attachments.images %}
  <img src="{{ image.thumbnail(64)|url }}">
{% endfor %}
```
