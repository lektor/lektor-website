body:

`rsync://username@server/path/to/folder`

This deploys via SSH and rsync to a remote server.  This is the recommended
way to deploy if the system supports it as it is a very fast and reliable
way.  It uses the system's SSH config so for authentication just configure
SSH as you would normally do.  The `username` part is optional and defaults
to the current user that is signed into the machine or whatever is picked up
as default from the `.ssh/config`.

You will need to change your `your-project-name.lektorproject` 
file to specify the server target. 

## Example

```ini
[servers.production]
target = rsync://deploy@example.com/var/www/example.com
```

## Credentials

The `rsync` deploy method supports both username and password parameter
though it's recommended to use `.ssh/config` and an SSH agent to secure
the deployment.  The `--password` parameter is not supported!  Instead you
need to use `--key-file` (`LEKTOR_DEPLOY_KEY_FILE`) or `--key`
(`LEKTOR_DEPLOY_KEY`).  The `--key-file` is the path to an OpenSSH private
key.

If you are using `--key` you can directly copy paste the contents of a key
into a string.  This is useful if you want to use it as an environment
variable.  The format for the string is `KEY_TYPE:BASE64` where `KEY_TYPE`
is the type of the key (`RSA`, `EC`, etc.) and `BASE64` is the base64 encoded
private key without newlines or whitespace.  To find out which type your
key is look at the first line of the key marker.  For instance `BEGIN EC
PRIVATE KEY` indicates an `EC` key.  If no key type is defined `RSA` is
assumed.
